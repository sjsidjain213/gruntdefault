In this assignment I have used very simple and basic view;
I have used localstorage feature of browser to store data. whenever "add" button will be clicked data will be stored in localstorage
of browser. 

on view side textarea is binded with localstorage when there will be a change in localstorage it will be reflected on view.

I have implemented  all the steps stated in "Internship Assignment" . However UI of page might not be  according to the steps mentioned in Assignment.
